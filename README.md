`re_math` is a 3D math library built on top of [`glam`](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs).

`re_math` is a fork of [`macaw`](https://crates.io/crates/macaw) by [Embark Studios](https://www.embark-studios.com/). Since `macaw` was never publicly published on git (AFICT), the first commit in this repository is a copy of [`macaw` 0.19.1 from crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/macaw/0.19.1). All further commits are changed made by Rerun.
